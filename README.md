# Task 1
##Objective of the Task

The primary goal is to create a Power BI visualization that provides insights into tweet performance during a specific period, focusing on engagement rate and impressions under defined criteria. This analysis is aimed at identifying trends and optimizing social media strategy based on tweet metrics.

##Conclusion

Key Findings:

1.	Engagement vs. Impressions:
Tweets with higher impressions typically have a stronger correlation with higher engagement rates, depending on content type and audience.
Filtering low-impression tweets (below 100) helps focus on impactful data.
2.	Time-Specific Trends:
The time-based restriction between 3 PM and 5 PM IST ensures analysis aligns with user activity peaks, optimizing engagement opportunities.

##Actionable Insights:

1.	Content Strategy:
 Focus on improving content that drives impressions and engagement during the specified time window.
Tweets with higher impressions often result from targeted campaigns or engaging content types.
3.	Timing Optimization:
Utilize the 3 PM–5 PM IST window for posting tweets to maximize visibility and engagement based on the filtered trends.

# Task 2

##Objective of the Task

 The primary goal is to create a clustered bar chart that provides insights into user interactions with tweets, categorized by tweet type. 
Conclusion

##Key Findings:

1.	Engagement Trends:
Tweet categories such as "Tweets with Media" often have higher interaction rates compared to tweets with links or hashtags.
Tweets posted during the specified time frame (3 PM–6 PM) show distinct patterns of user engagement.
2.	Impact of Word Count:
Tweets with fewer words (below 40) tend to encourage more concise messaging, which can influence interaction rates positively.
3.	Time and Date Impact:
The specific time window and even-numbered date filters help identify patterns based on user activity and engagement levels during different periods.


##Actionable Insights:

1.	Optimize Tweet Categories:
Focus more on creating tweets with media content if they consistently drive higher interactions.
Explore hashtag usage trends to identify the most engaging ones.
2.	Content Strategy:
Keep tweet messages concise (under 40 words) for better engagement.
Schedule tweets during the 3 PM–6 PM window, which seems to be an effective period for driving interactions.
